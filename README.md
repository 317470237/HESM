This repository provides the implementation for the paper [Hierarchical Evidence Set Modeling for Automated Fact Extraction and Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05111) (EMNLP 2020).

Shoutout to the authors of the work [Combining Fact Extraction and Verification with Neural Semantic Matching Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07039). Our implementation is built on top of their implementation from [combine-FEVER-NSMN](https://github.com/easonnie/combine-FEVER-NSMN).
